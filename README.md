what is done in the end of day 1:
1) Idea
2) Models to tag photos
3) Frontend draft
# Descritption:

The idea is as simple as that:
Men who are getting photos from camera-traps are very busy with 
analysing all data from them by hands. It is very time-consuming
to look through all this data. Out team thought to automate process of 
spotting weak animals or puppets. In the end of day one we discovered 
that actually for gender tagging and for weight tagging there is no data 
at all. So the solution is to provide one who wants to analyse 
camera-traps data with an oppotunity to add his own tags. 
For each tag there will be a binary claassifier which is trained on 
google servers and by trained I mean not only it's weight but also the 
architecture, so it is only data which is needed to start and process of 
training. The simple interface is providing anyone with oppotunity to 
analyse almost arbitrary data for almost arbitrary attribute.
